# EDS: Executable Data Structures

The `kb` is made using the executable object graph model. The idea is about
mixing data and program code in the form of a shared knowledge graph, formed by
multiple class objects (nodes). Due to existence of some set of node classes
that provides execution semantics, some subgraphs can be executed via the *data
interpreter*, and transform the graph itself.
