`kb` system builds and runs as an ordinary application for general-purpose OS
(Linux), but its architecture and use are targeted as the emulation of a
stand-alone system with its own resource management, tooling, custom GUI,
internal embedded interpreter/compiler, etc.

Virtualization is not a topic here (but can be used as a variant). The problem
is you will not have ability to use ready to use libraries for doing a lot of
things which can be considered as a real use.

## Why is Guest OS

The guest mode can be affordable and attractive for you, if you want to play
with low-level programming, programming methods and architectures differs a lot
from UNIX-like approaches, but still have a full power and external library
support from mainstream OS and community.
